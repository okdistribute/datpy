# DAT Python API

This is a client in python for [Dat](https://dat-data.com). There are functions to interact with the REST api as well as local hooks. It integrates easily with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org).

Hello, collaboration.

## What is Dat?

Dat is a open data project designed to make data more accessible:

* Track incremental changes made in datasets
* Designed to work with all data: big and small

Read the [docs](https://github.com/maxogden/dat) to learn more about Dat.

## Installation

  0. Install[dat](https://github.com/maxogden/dat)

  1. Install pip

  2. Obtain the Python dat package

    `pip install datpy`

## Usage

This is a new library and it needs work! Please don't hesitate to send a pull request or to open an issue if you find something wrong or broken. It's probably because we messed up!

Here's a simple example of how to read a dat's data into a pandas object, and then update the dat accordingly after editing the values.

```python
import datpy
import pandas as pd

dataframe = pd.read_csv('cities.csv')

dat = datpy.Dat()

## initialize dat
dat.init(tempdir())

## get a dataset (like a table or hdf5 dataframe)
dataset = dat.dataset('city_codes')

## uses the unique column 'city_code' to identify and version rows
v1 = dataset.import_dataframe(dataframe, key="city_codes")

## Get the data later at that version:
df = dataset.export_dataframe(checkout=v1)
```

[An ipython notebook example for dat](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pkafei/Dat-Python/blob/master/examples/Using%20Python%20with%20Dat.ipynb) (outdated)

## datpy.Dat

`Dat` is a class that binds to a Dat on your hard drive. Datasets are loaded streaming from the filesystem into python's memory.

For very large datasets and for code in production, please refer to the [dat commandline documentation](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/cli-usage.md) for stable and memory-safe interaction.

```python
> import datpy
> mydat = datpy.Dat('./path/to/dat/repo')
> mydat.init()
```

For each command, a `dat` instance accepts any of the options supported by Dat's [commandline api](http://datproject.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cli-docs/)


### clone

Clones the dat into a local directory on your filesystem.

`datpy.clone(URL, path=None, **kwargs*)`

Example:

```python
> import datpy
> mydat = datpy.clone('ssh://karissa@mydat.edu:/user/mydats/cities', "./cities")
```

## datpy.Dataset

Dataset-only commands must be performed using a dataset instance.

```python
> dataset = mydat.dataset("contracts")
```

### dataset.import_dataframe

Import rows from a pandas dataframe.

Returns the new version of the dat repository as a string.

```python
> df = pd.read_csv('examples/contracts.csv')
> dataset.import_dataframe(df, key='id')
'0eafefda2bcfee5'
```

### dataset.export_dataframe

Get data from the dat as a pandas dataframe.

```python
df = dataset.export_dataframe(checkout='0eafefda2bcfee5')
```

#### import_file

Import rows from a tabular file into dat.

Returns the new version of the dat repository as a string.

```python
> dataset.import_file('tables/cities.csv', key='cityId')
'abc2f3d234abc234ef1g13d'
```

#### export

Get the rows in the dat. This returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is the json representation of that row.

```python
> dataset.export(checkout='abc2f3d234abc234ef1g13d')
[
  {'key': 'abc2f3d234abc234ef1g13d',
  'vote_share': 51.33,
  'state': 'CA',
  'republican': True},
  {'key': 'df1cdf3c23bc234ef1g13d',
  'vote_share': 49.53,
  'state': 'DE',
  'republican': False},
  ...
]
```

# Developers

This is a new library and it needs work! Please don't hesitate to send a pull request.

## Contributing

First, create a fork, then install the requirements. Make your change and open a pull request!

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/<your-fork>/Dat-Python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ git commit -am "BUG: there was a bug that had this problem"
$ git push origin master
 ... open pull request!
```

## Testing

Install `nosetests` for the best testing environment. If you don't have `pandas` installed, it will skip the pandas tests.

```bash
nosetests
```

To run just one test

```bash
nosetests test.py:SimpleTest.test_rows
```

To run the entire suite without `nosetests`:

```bash
python tests/test.py
```

## Publishing

First, edit `setup.py` to bump the version number on both the `version` key and the `download_url`. Then, to push to pip/pypi:

```
python setup.py register -r pypi
python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
```
